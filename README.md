# ✈️ Airplane Crasher

✈️ Airplane Crasher
A 2D OpenGL-based Fighter Jet Game built with C++
🧩 Overview

Airplane Crasher is an interactive 2D arcade-style game developed using C++, OpenGL, and GLUT.
In this project, the player controls a fighter jet that must dodge falling obstacles, collect fuel cans, and survive as long as possible while maintaining smooth real-time gameplay.

This project was developed as part of the CSC4118: Computer Graphics course at American International University–Bangladesh (AIUB), demonstrating practical application of computer graphics principles such as transformations, animations, and event-driven interaction.

🎮 Features

🛩️ Player-controlled fighter jet (move using keyboard input)

☁️ Dynamic background with animated clouds and sun

🚀 Falling obstacles and collectible fuel cans

💥 Collision detection with score and life system

🌈 Smooth transitions using transformations and double-buffering

🔊 Optional background sound integration (via PlaySound() on Windows)

🧠 Concepts & Techniques

This project implements and demonstrates:

2D Transformations — translation, rotation, scaling

Matrix Stack Management using glPushMatrix() and glPopMatrix()

Timer-driven Animation via glutTimerFunc()

Event-driven Programming for keyboard and special key handling

Scene Rendering with OpenGL primitives (triangles, quads, polygons)

Double Buffering for smooth frame updates

⚙️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Graphics Library: OpenGL, GLUT

Platform: Windows (Win32 API for sound support)

📚 Purpose & Learning Outcome

This project was designed to:

Reinforce core computer graphics concepts such as rendering pipelines and coordinate transformations.

Demonstrate real-time animation and interactive event handling.

Build a foundation for game development and simulation software using OpenGL.
